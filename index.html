    <p style="background-color:Vermillion;">Games have been played for a long, long time now. Remember those countless hours we spent playing Pacman on the arcades or playing Pokemon on our Gameboy Colors as children? For sure we do .

While a lot of research has been done concerning the possible negative health effects of video gaming, it is not often highlighted the positive effects of video gaming, what is so appealing about games, and why we play and continue to play. However, numerous studies have been done showing the key factors of what motivates us to play games.
